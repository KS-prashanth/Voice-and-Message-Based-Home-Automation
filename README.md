# My-own-voice-based-assistant

I have built a voice based home automation system from scratch using
raspberry pi and some of the sensors. I have coded our program in python which helps
to understand the voice commands given by the user and perform the respective actions
and also the user receives some important messages through telegram bot which we have
created. I will different API’s available in python to get various real time information
like Google Cloud Speech API to convert the voice command into text, weather API to
get real time temperature and weather and also some other libraries to get the present time
and day.
So, in this project, we are going to build a Alexa kind of Raspberry-Pi based Voice
Assistance that can listen, respond, and control a few things. I have directly performed
Speech Recognition on Raspberry Pi, so we can directly connect a microphone to our Pi
and speak into it and in this report we will be talking about how we will be implementing
our project and the areas where we can improve our implementations.
